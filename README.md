# Hypothesis testing

While we recommend using Python to find the answers to these questions, it is not required. You are more than welcome to use a calculator or pencil and paper to solve them, too.

# Quiz - Hypothesis testing

?: You are asked to run a hypothesis test to test whether two sample means are different from each other or not. Your null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the sample means. Your alternative hypothesis is that the sample means are different from each other. You run the test and find a p-value of 0.01. Do you reject the null hypothesis?

( ) Yes, since the p-value is less than 0.05.

( ) We do not have enough information to assess whether we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or accept it.

(X) We do not have enough information to assess whether we have enough evidence to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

( ) No, since it is still likely that the sample means are not different from each other.
